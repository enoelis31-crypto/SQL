#  SQL Portfolio – by Enoelis Viera Ortiz  

Hi! I’m Enoelis, a data analyst in training, passionate about turning raw data into clear insights and business decisions.  
This portfolio is where I share my **SQL projects**, each one built around real-world business questions.  

I believe SQL is more than just queries – it’s about **storytelling with data**.
